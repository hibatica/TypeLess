# TypeLess
Typing the same command over and over? This is a collection of shell scripts to help you type those commands less

# Usage

# [Step 1]
In the TypeLess folder, run:
`chmod +x setup.sh`

`./setup.sh`

All this does is ensure all the scripts in the TypeLess folder are executable.

# [Step 2]

Read the comments at the begining of each script to see what it does and inspect them if you have any sense of security

# [Step 3]

Run your desired scripts
